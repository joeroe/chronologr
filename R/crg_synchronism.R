# crg_synchronism.R
# S3 vectors of synchronisms â€“ temporal relations between two periods

#' Temporal synchronism
#'
#' A synchronism defines a known relation between two periods.
#'
#' @param relation Function describing the type of relation, see [crg_relation()]
#' @param x Unique character label of the first period
#' @param y Unique character label of the second period
#'
#' @details
#' `x` and `y` are [recycled to a common length][vctrs::theory-faq-recycling].
#'
#' @return A vector of temporal synchronisms
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' synchronism(crg_equals, "A", "B")
